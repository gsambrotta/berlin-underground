#The Standard Hotel, Fitzroy

A beautiful old pub in Fitzroy with great food and atmosphere. Not *cheap*, but **rad**

The beer selection is vast, from local simple staples of Melbourne and Victorian Bitter, to higher quality craft beers like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, Pacific Pale Ale and Mountain Goat. Guiness is also available, and well poured by the hipster bar staff.
