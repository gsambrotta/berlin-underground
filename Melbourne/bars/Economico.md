Decked out like somewhere you would expect to be invited to a cock fight,
Economico is build on the gravestone of Der Raum, Richmonds favorite cocktail bar.
The only beer availible is Telante. In a can. As such, Economico isn't reccomended 
for the beer lover, however if you are in the mood they make a mean Mojito.
