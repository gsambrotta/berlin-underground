Padre Coffee was born at the Brunswick East Project, back in 2008. Essentially a two-man operation, back then we roasted, brewed and sold all of our coffee under the one roof; making friends, having fun and learning as we went. The Project is still there, and a lot of our first customers are as well – in fact, we’re proud to say that it’s thanks to the support of loyal, coffee-loving locals that we’ve grown up to be the company we are today.
