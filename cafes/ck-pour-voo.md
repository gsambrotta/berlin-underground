# CK pour Voo

Oranienstr. 24, 10999 Berlin Kreuzberg 
Mo-Sa: 11-18 Uhr.

Voo is a cool( but pricey ) concept shop hidden in the popular Oranienstr. in Kreuzberg. Luckily they have a cafe shop which serves some of the best coffee in Berlin. Try to catch Travis, one of the baristas, for a great coffee and a conversation about the meaning of life...
