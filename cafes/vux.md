_For vegans and anybody loving really yummy and healthy food :)_

*The main reason to go here: Really big, handmade cakes, that make you yearn for more!*

You can of course have a delicious fair-trade coffee either with soy or rice milk, drink chocolate or tea specialties with it. They also have cookies, cupcakes and waffles mit hot fruits & whipped soy cream. And at least on of the cakes is made with spelt flour.

If you don't have a sweet tooth, they can mix you tropical smoothies made from açaí, maracujá, coconut, mango, guava or cashew-fruit. OR you try one of the daily soups & salads or bagels with fresh sprouts, marinated tofu-saté, seitan-limão, guava jelly and vegan cheese, houmous or sausage with caramelized onions.
