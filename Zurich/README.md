The Zurich Underground
======================

We are a super-secret underground organisation for Zurich
awesomeness. Aside from world domination, we aim to collect all the
great cafes, bars and restaurants in Zurich together in one place.

Once collected, we'll have a nice coffee, maybe a nice falafel or two,
then continue our world domination plans over a drink.

Upload your brain!

The goal of this exercise is to contribute your knowledge of Zurich to
the original repo:
[OpenTechSchool/underground](https://github.com/OpenTechSchool/underground).
Unfortunately for you, The Head Coach doesn't accept pull requests from just anyone.
He'll only take pull requests from his lieutenants, the class coaches.

So find your coach!
