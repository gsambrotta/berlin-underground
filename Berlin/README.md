The Berlin Underground
======================

We are a super-secret underground organisation for Berlin 
awesomeness. Aside from world domination, we aim to collect all the 
great cafes, bars and restaurants in Berlin together in one place.

Once collected, we'll have a nice coffee, maybe a nice falafel or two, 
then continue our world domination plans over a drink.

Upload your brain!

The goal of this exercise is to contribute your knowledge of Berlin to 
the original repo: 
[OpenTechSchool/underground](https://github.com/OpenTechSchool/underground). 
Unfortunately for you, The Head Coach doesn't accept pull requests from just anyone. 
He'll only take pull requests from his lieutenants, the class coaches.

So find your coach!
