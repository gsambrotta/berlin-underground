# Kamine und Wein

The address is Prinzenallee 58 in Wedding

This place is a very cozy place, especially in winter, when they light the 
fireplaces. They also sell some good wines, they usually have ten to fifteen 
different wines open every evening, and a glass costs between 2 and 5 euro.

They also sell the fireplaces if you feel like spending lots of money on one.
