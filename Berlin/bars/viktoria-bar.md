# Viktoria Bar

The real deal. An established western Berlin bar and one of the best choices for the perfect drink. High standard but open for everyone. My favs are the Ford Cocktail, Pick Me Up and the classic Dry Martini. Don't forget to try one of the sandwiches or the cheese plate!

Check out the happy hour every day from 18.30 to 21.30 to get quality for little money.
