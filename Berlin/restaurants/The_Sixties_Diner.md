# The Sixties Diner

Here's the adress of a nice restaurant in the style of an classic
american diner 50 years ago.
Very rich selection of american food and drinks. Very delicious and prices are okay too.
On weekends seatings may be rare. All in all very advisable.
Be careful of "special women" at night ;D.
