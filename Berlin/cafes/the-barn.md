# The Barn

Auguststrasse 58

Some of the best coffee in Germany! I recommend the filtered coffee,
served black of course. Their Aeropress coffees are also fun to watch
being made.

# Passenger Espresso

Oppelnerstr. 45

Run by Kiwis, so they know how to make a good coffee. A mix of good music, imcluding old, obscure analog recordings.
